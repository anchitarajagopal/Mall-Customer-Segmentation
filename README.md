In this project, we figure out who the best customers are. 
  Explore the general distribution of the data to get a sense of Male vs. Female customers, and how their income, age, and spending scores are similar or different.
  Explore which gender has a higher income.
  Explore which gender has a higher average spending score.
  
Setup:
You will need to have numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

The data set is from Kaggle and can be downloaded from this repo.

Based on these data, the following hypotheses could be tested:
Marketing cheaper items to women to see if they purchase more frequently or more volume.
Marketing more to younger women because their spending score tends to be higher.
Thinking up new ways to target advertising, pricing, branding, etc. to the older women (older than early 40s) who have lower spending scores.


KPIs
In the spirit of business use cases, I'll define the following KPIs as an example to show how you would know if your efforts are paying off or not. 
The change in frequency and volume of purchases by women after the introduction of more marketing campaigns targeting them.
The change in spending score after introducing marketing campaigns targeting younger women.
The change in spending score after introducing marketing campaigns targeting older women.
